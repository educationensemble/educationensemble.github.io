        <p id ="about"> Hi, my name is Arjun Gupta, and I am the founder of Ã‰ducation ensemble. I founded this organization after seeing the impact the pandemic was having on the workforce. <br> Workers who did not possess a technical knowledge and education were being laid off at an unprecedented level. Thus, I decided to work towards addressing this huge issue in my own community.</br> </p>
