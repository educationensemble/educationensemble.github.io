<p> As part of my efforts to upskill the community, I personally developed and led courses in Web Designed based programming and IT. 
	<br> I partnered with workforce programs and local vocational schools to offer these lessons to disadvantaged members of our community. </br>

	One major program offered by this non-profit is Web Design. In this program, we helped our students learn HTML, CSS ana JavaScript while also helping them develop their own websites. Our students have passed industry certifications in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. After completing our program, many of our students were able to find high paying positions in the industry.
